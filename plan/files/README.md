# Pitwall

Fan-built F1 race intelligence platform built on the [OpenF1 API](https://openf1.org). Provides real-time telemetry, inferred strategy metrics, ambient environment control, and a sharable layout system.

Not affiliated with Formula 1, FIA, or Formula One Management.

## Data source

All race data comes from OpenF1.

| Tier | Cost | What you get |
|---|---|---|
| Historical | Free | 2023–present sessions, all 33 widgets, all inferred metrics, no live updates |
| Live | $10/month (your own key) | ~3-second real-time data, WebSocket feed, all 18 endpoints, team radio |

**You must provide your own OpenF1 API key for live data.** The key is stored in localStorage (desktop: OS keychain) and never sent to Pitwall's servers. All API calls go directly from your browser to `api.openf1.org`.

There is no workaround for live data. Real-time OpenF1 requires a paid subscription and Pitwall cannot relay it without violating OpenF1's terms.

## Features

### Widgets

33 widgets across 8 categories. Every widget is drag-and-drop. Every widget has a four-tab settings panel (Display, Driver, Formula, Advanced). The Formula tab is only visible on inferred widgets.

**Timing & Gaps** (6 widgets)
- Lap Delta Tower — ranked list of all drivers with lap time, gap to leader, interval, and 3-lap trend arrow
- Lap Time Card — single-driver lap time with sector splits, personal best comparison, and 8-lap sparkline
- Gap Evolution Chart — line chart of gap between two configurable drivers across the session
- Stint Pace Comparison — average stint pace across drivers filtered to the same compound age window
- Head-to-Head Delta — two drivers, one configurable metric (lap time, top speed, sector, deg rate, traffic loss)
- Sector Mini-Cards — S1/S2/S3 time cards with session/personal best coloring and theoretical best lap

**Telemetry** (7 widgets)
- Speed Gauge — real-time speed readout with gear and rpm, radial gauge or numeric card, 3.7 Hz

### Ambient race layer

A persistent banner communicates race state through color. On every flag change a toast notification announces the event text then fades out. The gradient color remains as a passive signal after the toast disappears.

State priority order: Red flag → Safety car → Virtual SC → Yellow flag → Fastest lap (2.8s pulse) → Lead change (team color flash) → Green (with or without leader team color).

An optional RGB bridge connects to WLED, Philips Hue, Govee, or MQTT so physical lights in the room follow the same events.

### Window and workspace system

A workspace is a named configuration containing canvases, a focus driver, ambient settings, and radio config. Multiple browser windows can show different canvas tabs from the same workspace and sync live via BroadcastChannel API (~16ms). Windows in different workspaces are fully independent.

### Driver context system

Every widget targets driver data through one of three mechanisms:

| Context | Indicator | Behavior |
|---|---|---|
| Canvas inherit | `FOCUS` | Default. Follows whatever driver the canvas is focused on. |
| Position role | `P1` / `P2` / `P3` / `GAP±1` | Follows the live race position. Auto-switches on position changes. |
| Specific driver | `PINNED` | Locked to one named driver regardless of any other changes. |

Widget border styles communicate context type: green dashed for FOCUS, gold dashed for role, purple dashed for PINNED.

### Layout export and sharing

Canvases export as a compact human-readable code string encoding all widget positions, sizes, driver contexts, formula overrides, and settings. Paste the code into Pitwall on any device to restore the layout exactly. No account required on either end.

Format:
```
pw:v1 · ws:"Race day" · focus:VER · theme:dark
widgets:[lap_delta·2x1, ers_deploy·1x1, tyre_age·1x1@NOR, traffic·1x1, battery·1x1, weather·1x1]
ambient:on · leader_color:on · rgb:wled · radio:scanner
```

### Inference engine

OpenF1 does not expose ERS state, battery level, tyre wear, fuel load, or engine mode. These are inferred from available telemetry. All inferred values carry an `~EST` label.

| Metric | Accuracy |
|---|---|
| Traffic time loss | ~85% |
| Deg rate | ~80% |
| Tyre cliff lap | ±3 laps |
| Pit urgency score | ~70% |
| ERS deploy zone | ~70% |
| Tyre wear % | ~65% |
| Engine mode | ~60% |
| Battery SOC | ~50% |
| Fuel load estimate | ~45% |

All formulas are editable in the widget's Formula tab. The formula builder shows a live preview against historical session data. Community formulas are publishable to a shared registry.

Default tyre cliff formula:
```
BASE_WINDOW = { SOFT: 18, MEDIUM: 28, HARD: 40, INTER: 35, WET: 50 }
CLIFF_LAP = stint_start_lap
           + BASE_WINDOW[compound]
           - (track_temp - 45) × 0.3
           - deg_rate × 1.8
           + sc_laps × 2.1
```

## Error handling

| State | Error code | Behavior |
|---|---|---|
| OpenF1 unreachable | `ERR_OPENF1_UNREACHABLE` | Auto-retry every 15s, show cached data |
| No network | `ERR_OFFLINE` | Offline banner, historical mode |
| Pre-session | `ERR_PRE_SESSION` | Countdown, polls for session every 60s, connects automatically |
| No season data | `ERR_NO_SEASON_DATA` | Season picker, 2023+ available |
| Update required | `ERR_UPDATE_REQUIRED` | Archive mode — full historical functionality, no live feed |
| Invalid API key | `ERR_INVALID_API_KEY` | Re-enter key screen, fall back to historical |

Archive mode keeps all 33 widgets functional on historical data. A persistent banner indicates archive status.

Diagnostic logs are accessible at Settings → Diagnostics. Last 1,000 entries retained in memory. Export as JSON. Optional opt-in Sentry integration for crash reporting (no personal data, no usage tracking).

## Quick start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourname/pitwall.git
cd pitwall
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:5173`. On first launch you will be prompted for an OpenF1 API key. Skipping the key starts the app in historical mode.

## F1TV overlay (Phase 4)

Pitwall can run as a transparent overlay window above F1TV or any other streaming application using Electron's compositor-level window APIs. Pitwall draws on top — it does not capture, record, or re-transmit stream content. Compliance with F1TV terms of service is the user's responsibility. Phase 4 only, not yet built.
