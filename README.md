## Intro

Pitwall is built for fans who want team-style race context in one place: timing, telemetry, strategy, weather, radio events, and inferred signals that OpenF1 does not expose directly.

The goal is to make race intelligence configurable, shareable, and useful in real time.


Works great with [F1 Sensor](https://github.com/Nicxe/f1_sensor)

## Features

Implemented outcomes in the current product:

| Area | Current result |
|---|---|
| Canvas and workspace foundation | Multi-tab canvas with persistent layout state |
| Driver targeting system | Focus, role-based, and pinned driver modes |
| Ambient race-state UX | Flag-driven top bar with smooth transitions and event pulses |
| Season content | 2026 assets, manifests, and team/driver metadata |
| Standings coverage | Live projected driver and constructor standings |
| Historical continuity | Archive mode support for historical race browsing |

### Widget catalog coverage

Pitwall targets a 33-widget catalog across timing, telemetry, tyres, map, weather, audio, championship, and visual views.

### Workspace flexibility

Different workspaces can follow different race stories at the same time.

| Workspace 1 | Workspace 2 |
|---|---|
| ![Canvas 1](plan/demo/canvas1.png) | ![Canvas 2](plan/demo/canvas2.png) |

### Multi-widget, multi-driver analysis

Multiple instances of the same widget can target different drivers in parallel.

| Driver manager and starring | Same widget type, different driver targets |
|---|---|
| ![Driver Manager](plan/demo/driverManager.png) | ![Driver Select and Individual](plan/demo/driverSelectAndIndividual.png) |

### Export/import system

Pitwall layouts can be exported and imported so users can move setups between devices and share race dashboards.

Season updates and changes will be released through season `.pitwall` files and bundled with the latest updates.

### Historical race feature

Archive mode keeps historical race analysis available when live feed is unavailable.

### Inference engine

OpenF1 does not expose direct ERS state, battery level, tyre wear %, fuel load, or engine mode. Pitwall computes estimated values from available telemetry and session data.
